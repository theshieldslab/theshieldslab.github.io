### Robert Shields - Assistant Professor     
I earned my PhD in Microbiology at Newcastle University (United Kingdom) in Nick Jakubovics lab, where I worked on extracellular DNA in microbial biofilms, and potential control of biofilms with eDNA-degrading enzymes. In August 2014 I moved to the USA where I worked in the lab of Bob Burne (University of Florida) on cell-cell communication and regulation of gene expression in *Streptococcus mutans*. I was hired as a Research Assistant 
Professor in the Department of Oral Biology at UF in July 2017 and moved to Arkansas State to start my own lab in August 2021. After four successful years at A-State I moved my research program back to UF.

### Luana Dias - Postdoctoral Associate
I am a Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS), graduated in 2017, with an internship period at UCSD Health Sciences (San Diego, USA), and hold a Master’s and PhD in Oral Rehabilitation from São Paulo State University (UNESP-Araraquara), Brazil, granted through a cotutelle/dual-degree program with the College of Dentistry at the University of Saskatchewan, Canada (2020–2025). My research focuses on oral microbiology, molecular biology, and cell culture. I have received the IADR Colgate Award for Research in Microbiology and had the privilege of co-mentoring over 15 dental research students across Brazil and Canada. My expertise aims to strengthen translational and interdisciplinary research in oral health, bridging basic science discoveries into clinical applications.

### Kipa Tamrakar - Biological Scientist
I am a Biological Scientist in Dr. Robert Shields’ lab at the University of Florida. I earned my MS degree in Molecular Biosciences at Arkansas State University, where I studied microbial interaction in soybean plant.  My current work focuses on construction of a comprehensive mutant library of Streptococcus mutans to characterize essential genes involved in protein post-translational modification. Broadly, I am interested in how genetic mechanisms influence microbial behavior in the host. Outside the lab, I enjoy cooking and travelling.

### Indumini Balasuriya - PhD Biomedical Sciences
I completed my B.S. in Microbiology and Biotechnology from Edinburgh Napier University, UK, studying at its affiliated institute in Sri Lanka, the Spectrum Institute of Science and Technology. I conducted a research project exploring the immunomodulatory properties of Cucumis melo fruit extract, more of a biotechnological research topic and later gained hands-on experience in a CAP-accredited clinical laboratory, Lanka Hospital Diagnostics, working in the microbiology department. Currently, I’m pursuing my PhD in Immunology and Microbiology in Dr. Shields’ lab at the Department of Oral Biology, UF. My research focuses on understanding the regulatory mechanisms that control the excision and transfer of TnSmu1, an integrative and conjugative element (ICE) found in *Streptococcus mutans*.

### Bikash Kumar Dwivedi - PhD Biomedical Sciences
I have completed my undergraduate in Microbiology from St. Xavier's College, Kathmandu, Nepal. I developed this particular interest and passion to work on bacteria during my undergraduate studies. I worked on a project related to antibiotic resistance. Currently, I am pursuing my PhD in Biomedical Sciences in Dr. Shields laboratory. I will be working on TnSmu1, an ICE that has been discovered in *Streptococcus mutans*. I like watching sports, mainly cricket in my free time and newly released movies/series.

### Karen Solano - M.S. Biology<br />
I graduated with a Bachelor's in Biotechnology from the A-State campus in Queretaro, Mexico, in 2023. In spring 2023, I joined the Shields Lab as an undergraduate student while participating in an exchange program.
In the spring of 2024, I started my Master's in Biology with research focused on the construction and sequencing of an arrayed Tn library as a resource for the *S. mutans* community. After graduating in December 2025, I plan to pursue a Ph.D. in microbiology.<br />

### Kelvin Gonzalez - B.S. Microbiology and Health Education<br />
I’m an undergraduate student at the University of Florida double majoring in Microbiology and Health Education. I joined the Shields Lab in Fall 2025. I’ve always been interested in research, and after working in a fruit fly genetics lab and completing a summer research program at the NYU College of Dentistry, I fell in love with it and wanted to continue doing research that connects more to my interests in dentistry. In my free time, I enjoy running, crocheting, and watching movies. After graduation, I plan to attend dental school and continue doing research there.
