### Robert Shields - Assistant Professor<br />               
I earned my PhD in Microbiology at Newcastle University (United Kingdom) in Nick Jakubovics lab, where I worked on extracellular DNA in microbial biofilms, and potential control of biofilms with eDNA-degrading enzymes. In August 2014 I moved to the USA where I worked in the lab of Bob Burne (University of Florida) on cell-cell communication and regulation of gene expression in *Streptococcus mutans*. I was hired as a Research Assistant 
Professor in the Department of Oral Biology at UF in July 2017 and moved to Arkansas State to start my own lab in August 2021.

### Shawn King - Research Technician/Lab Manager
Since graduating Arkansas State University in December 2021 with my degree in Biological Sciences I have been working in the Shields research lab. I have gained many skills working in research, setting me up to apply to future 
career jobs. My current project is investigating the function of an integrative and conjugative element (ICE) TnSmu1 located in *Streptococcus mutans* when exposed to DNA damaging agents such as Mitomycin C. In my spare time my 
hobbies include cooking, reading, drawing, and PlayStation 5.

### Bikash Kumar Dwivedi - PhD Molecular Biosciences
I have completed my undergraduate in Microbiology from St. Xavier's College, Kathmandu, Nepal. I developed this particular interest and passion to work on bacteria during my undergraduate studies. I worked on a project related to antibiotic resistance. Currently, I am pursuing my PhD in Molecular Biosciences in Dr. Shields laboratory. I will be working on TnSmu1 gene, ICEs that has been discovered in *Streptococcus mutans*. I like watching sports, mainly cricket in my free time and newly released movies/series.

### Courtney Dover - M.S. Biology
My research involves the functional characterization of hypothetical essential genes in samples of *Streptococcus mutans* that have been modified using CRISPRi. When I'm not in the lab, you can find me crocheting, reading, or 
playing video games. After I graduate, I plan to pursue a PhD in Microbiology.

### Karen Solano - M.S. Biology<br />
I graduated with a Bachelor's in Biotechnology from the A-State campus in Queretaro, Mexico, in 2023. In spring 2023, I joined the Shields Lab as an undergraduate student while participating in an exchange program.
In the spring of 2024, I started my Master's in Biology with research focused on the construction and sequencing of an arrayed Tn library as a resource for the *S. mutans* community. After graduating in December 2025, I plan to pursue a Ph.D. in microbiology.<br />

### Erica Lee - DO (NYIT-COM at A-State)<br />
I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Biochemistry from the University of Washington—Seattle in 2019. As an undergraduate student researcher, I joined Dr. Olivia Bermingham-McDonogh’s lab, studying the regeneration and  development of mice's inner ear, and Dr. Mary Lidstrom’s lab, studying molecular and metabolic manipulations of methylotrophic bacteria. In 2022, I joined Nanostring Technologies Inc. in developing their technology and assay 
for studying spatial genomics. In August 2022, I joined the NYIT College of Osteopathic Medicine at Arkansas State University to pursue a career as an osteopathic physician. In November 2022, I joined Dr. Troy Camarata's lab to 
study the regeneration and development of the kidney. In June 2023, I joined the Shields lab. Currently, I’m studying virulence factors within conjugative elements (ICEs and IMEs) in Streptococci species.<br />

### Sangam Chudal - B.S. Biotechnology<br />
I am a B.S. Biotechnology major in my sophomore year at Arkansas State University. My research involves bypassing essential genes in *Streptococcus mutans* to discover potential gain-of-function mutants. I joined The Shields 
Lab as an undergraduate research student in June 2023. Apart from research, I love watching movies, TV shows and listening to music. My all-time favorite movie is Dead Poets Society.<br />

### Emanuel Cazano - B.S. Biology<br />
I am a Biology major with an emphasis on Pre-Professional Studies. I have been working in the Shields Molecular Microbiology Laboratory since January of 2024. I am working alongside others on a project to construct a Tn library to use as a resource for further studies of *S. mutans*. After graduating in December 2025, I plan on attending medical school to pursue my dream of becoming a physician. In my free time I enjoy running, biking, backpacking, and trout fishing.
