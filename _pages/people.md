### Robert Shields - Assistant Professor               
I earned my PhD in Microbiology at Newcastle University (United Kingdom) in Nick Jakubovics lab, where I worked on extracellular DNA in microbial biofilms, and potential control of biofilms with eDNA-degrading enzymes. In August 2014 I moved to the USA where I worked in the lab of Bob Burne (University of Florida) on cell-cell communication and regulation of gene expression in *Streptococcus mutans*. I was hired as a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Oral Biology at UF in July 2017 and moved to Arkansas State to start my own lab in August 2021.

I began my research in the Shields lab in October 2021 as a research technician and finished screening and testing pyrazole derivatives compounds in late December and January for inhibition against S. mutans. I graduated from Arkansas State University with my Bachelors of Science in Biological Sciences on December 18th 2021. In February I rejoined the research laboratory as a research assistant/technician and laboratory manager. In my spare time I enjoy reading Harry Potter and playing video games and I love to cook in the kitchen. I have 2 geckos, one golden gecko and leopard gecko. Their names are Izzabella and Dizzy.

### Bryant Reed - B.S. Biotechnology
I am a 3rd-year B.S Biotechnology major and I am currently working in the Shields Lab as a research technician where I am testing various stilbenoid compounds against *S. mutans*. An interesting fact was that I was originally a Biology major (pre-med). However, after discovering my love of the lab and that I can help as many people in a lab as I could in a hospital, I decided to work on a B.S. of Biotechnology. After I graduate I hope to get into a graduate program and eventually, work my way up to getting my Ph.D. in Molecular Biosciences.<br />

### Makenzie Rone - B.S. Biology
I am a senior biological sciences student and I am working in Dr. Shieldsâ€™ lab as a researcher. I am currently testing Arkansas soils for antibiotic producing bacteria, as well as testing Tiny Earth protocols. My plans after graduation include continuing to conduct research, as well as choosing a doctorate program to apply to.  One fun fact about me is that I serve as Secretary for the Women In Science.
