&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ### Robert Shields - Assistant Professor<br />               
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I earned my PhD in Microbiology at Newcastle University (United Kingdom) in Nick Jakubovics lab, where I worked on extracellular DNA in microbial biofilms, and potential control of biofilms with &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eDNA-degrading enzymes. In August 2014 I moved to the USA where I worked in the lab of Bob Burne (University of Florida) on cell-cell communication and regulation of gene expression in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Streptococcus mutans*. I was hired as a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Oral Biology at UF in July 2017 and moved to Arkansas State to start my own lab in August 2021.

   ### Shawn King - Research Technician/Lab Manager<br />
   Since graduating Arkansas State University in December 2021 with my degree in Biological Sciences I have been working in the Shields research lab. I have gained many skills working in research, setting me up to apply to future 
   career jobs. My current project is investigating the function of an integrative and conjugative element (ICE) TnSmu1 located in *Streptococcus mutans* when exposed to DNA damaging agents such as Mitomycin C. In my spare time 
   my hobbies include cooking, reading, drawing, and PlayStation 5.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;### Courtney Dover - M.S. Biology<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My research involves the functional characterization of hypothetical essential genes in samples of *Streptococcus mutans* that have been modified using CRISPRi. When I'm not in the lab, you can &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;find me crocheting, reading, or playing video games. After I graduate, I plan to pursue a PhD in Microbiology.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;### Karen Solano - M.S. Biology<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am currently working in the Shields Molecular Microbiology Laboratory, constructing an ordered Tn library as a resource for the *S.mutans* community. This project was funded by the Arkansas &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IDeA Network of Biomedical Research Excellence (Arkansas INBRE). After graduating in December 2025, I am planning to pursue a Ph.D. in the field of microbiology.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;### Erica Lee - DO (NYIT at A-State)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Biochemistry from the University of Washington—Seattle in 2019. As an undergraduate student researcher, I joined Dr. Olivia Bermingham-McDonogh’s lab, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;studying the regeneration and development of mice's inner ear, and Dr. Mary Lidstrom’s lab, studying molecular and metabolic manipulations of methylotrophic bacteria. In 2022, I joined &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanostring Technologies Inc. in developing their technology and assay for studying spatial genomics. In August 2022, I joined the NYIT College of Osteopathic Medicine at Arkansas State &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;University to pursue a career as an osteopathic physician. In November 2022, I joined Dr. Troy Camarata's lab to study the regeneration and development of the kidney. In June 2023, I joined the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shields lab. Currently, I’m studying virulence factors within conjugative elements (ICEs and IMEs) in Streptococci species.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;### Sangam Chudal - B.S. Biotechnology<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a B.S. Biotechnology major in my sophomore year at Arkansas State University. My research involves bypassing essential genes in *Streptococcus mutans* to discover potential gain-of-function &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mutants. I joined The Shields Lab as an undergraduate research student in June 2023. Apart from research, I love watching movies, TV shows and listening to music. My all-time favorite movie is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead Poets Society.<br />

### Manushi Pandey - B.S. Biotechnology<br />
I'm a B.S. Biotechnology major, stepping into my junior year come Spring 2024. The world of research has always captivated me, and I'm thrilled  be a part of it. I love rewatching my all-time favorite series, The Big Bang Theory. My family is my biggest motivation, and I really enjoy spending time with them. I’m excited for the adventures ahead in both my academic and personal journey!<br />
