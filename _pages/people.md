### Join the lab!

We are really interested in aspiring microbiologists who want to join the team. A typical undergraduate committment would be 8-12 hours of lab work each week. For students interested in this, please drop by my office (Room X Lab Sciences East) or enquire by email.

Types of undergraduate projects:
1) Functional genomics screens
2) Gene mutagenesis and characterization of mutant
3) Analysis of pre-exisiting data (e.g. RNAseq, genomic sequencing, etc)

### The PI - Robert Shields

I was born in South Africa but raised in the county of Yorkshire in England. I earned my PhD in Microbiology at Newcastle University (United Kingdom) in Nick Jakubovics lab, where I worked on extracellular DNA in microbial biofilms, and potential control of biofilms with eDNA-degrading enzymes. In August 2014 I moved to the USA and did a postdoc in the lab of Bob Burne at the University of Florida, working on cell-cell communication and regulation of gene expression in Streptococcus mutans. I was hired as a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Oral Biology at UF in July 2017.
