### Robert Shields - Assistant Professor               
I earned my PhD in Microbiology at Newcastle University (United Kingdom) in Nick Jakubovics lab, where I worked on extracellular DNA in microbial biofilms, and potential control of biofilms with eDNA-degrading enzymes. In August 2014 I moved to the USA where I worked in the lab of Bob Burne (University of Florida) on cell-cell communication and regulation of gene expression in *Streptococcus mutans*. I was hired as a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Oral Biology at UF in July 2017 and moved to Arkansas State to start my own lab in August 2021.

### Shawn King - Research Technician
I began my research in the Shields lab in October 2021 as a research technician and finished screening and testing pyrazole derivatives compounds in late December and January for inhibition against *S. mutans*. I graduated from Arkansas State University with my Bachelors of Science in Biological Sciences on December 18th 2021. In February I rejoined the research laboratory as a research assistant/technician and laboratory manager. In my spare time I enjoy reading Harry Potter and playing video games and I love to cook in the kitchen. I have 2 geckos, one golden gecko and a leopard gecko. Their names are Izzabella and Dizzy.

### Makenzie Rone - B.S. Biology
I am a senior biological sciences student and I am working in Dr. Shieldsâ€™ lab as a researcher. I am currently testing Arkansas soils for antibiotic producing bacteria, as well as testing Tiny Earth protocols. My plans after graduation include continuing to conduct research, as well as choosing a doctorate program to apply to.  One fun fact about me is that I serve as Secretary for the Women In Science.<br />

### Allison Quick - B.S. Biology
I am a senior biological sciences major and currently working on microbial bioinformatics using the tool ICEfinder to detect ICE/IMEs in *S. mutans* genomes. After I graduate, I plan to go to dental school. One fun fact about me is that I am currently the president of the Pre-Dental Club.
