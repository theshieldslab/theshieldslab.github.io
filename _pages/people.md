**Robert Shields**\
*Principal Investigator*\
I was born in South Africa but raised in the county of Yorkshire in England. I earned my PhD in Microbiology at Newcastle University (United Kingdom) in Nick Jakubovics lab, where I worked on extracellular DNA in microbial biofilms, and potential control of biofilms with eDNA-degrading enzymes. In August 2014 I moved to the USA and did a postdoc in the lab of Bob Burne at the University of Florida, working on cell-cell communication and regulation of gene expression in Streptococcus mutans. I was hired as a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Oral Biology at UF in July 2017.
