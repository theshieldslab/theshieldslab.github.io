The long-term goal of the lab is to understand the mechanisms by which Gram positive pathogens cause disease, using Streptococcus mutans as a paradigm. This includes addressing which genes are essential for pathogenesis, and what is the role of other bacteria in promoting or reducing S. mutans colonization. Systems and synthetic biology techniques are critical tools for addressing these problems. Understanding the biology of this organism will allow us to develop new treatment modalities, both against S. mutans and other streptococcal pathogens.
