## The Problem

The long-term goal of the lab is to understand the mechanisms by which Gram positive pathogens cause disease, using [*Streptococcus mutans*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_mutans) as a paradigm. This includes addressing which genes are essential for pathogenesis, and what is the role of other bacteria in promoting or reducing *S. mutans* colonization. Systems and synthetic biology techniques are critical tools for addressing these problems. Understanding the biology of this organism will allow us to develop new treatment modalities, both against *S. mutans* and other streptococcal pathogens. 

## The Tools

We use a variety of methods, both traditional and modern, to understand how *Streptococcus mutans* causes tooth decay.
