## The Problem

The long-term goal of the lab is to understand the mechanisms by which Gram positive pathogens cause disease, using [*Streptococcus mutans*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_mutans) as a paradigm. This includes addressing which genes are essential for pathogenesis, and what is the role of other bacteria in promoting or reducing *S. mutans* colonization. Systems and synthetic biology techniques are critical tools for addressing these problems. Understanding the biology of this organism will allow us to develop new treatment modalities, both against *S. mutans* and other streptococcal pathogens. 

## The Tools

We use a variety of methods, both traditional and modern, to understand how *Streptococcus mutans* causes tooth decay.

## The Projects

### To better understand genes that are required for bacteria to survive

Essential genes are those that are absolutely required for the survival of bacteria. Knowledge of essential genes is important for two main reasons, 1) they highlight fundamental processes of bacteria, and 2) they may offer targets for new antimicrobial therapeutics. We leverage genome-wide functional genomics tools to identify and study genes that are critical for *S. mutans* survival; these techniques including transposon sequencing and CRISPR interference.

### Precision editing of the oral microbiome

Our lab is interested in applying CRISPRi and related technologies to discover anti-*S. mutans* therapeutics. We are currently working on an antimicrobial that represses essential gene expression to eliminate the growth of *S. mutans*.
