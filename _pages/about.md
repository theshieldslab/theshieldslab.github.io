The Shields Lab in the [Department of Biological Sciences](http://www.astate.edu/college/sciences-and-mathematics/departments/biology/) at [Arkansas State University](https://www.astate.edu/) investigates Streptococcus mutans physiology using functional genomics techniques (Tn-seq, CRISPRi, etc). The end goal is to develop novel antimicrobials to kill Streptococcus mutans. Streptococcus mutans infections are a significant problem in dental health, as they help cause tooth decay.
