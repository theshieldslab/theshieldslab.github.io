The Shields Lab in the [Department of Biological Sciences](http://www.astate.edu/college/sciences-and-mathematics/departments/biology/) at [Arkansas State University](https://www.astate.edu/) investigates Streptococcus mutans physiology using functional genomics techniques (Tn-seq, CRISPRi, etc). The end goal is to develop novel antimicrobials to kill Streptococcus mutans. Streptococcus mutans infections are a significant problem in dental health, as they help cause tooth decay.

Rob's collaborator [Dr. Kelly Rice](http://microcell.ufl.edu/people/faculty-directory/rice/) was awarded a new grant from NASA entitled "Assessing the impact of Agr Quorum Sensing on Staphylococcus aureus Physiology in the Space Flight Environment". [See here for a link to the award announcement](https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/biological-physical/SpaceBiologyProgramNRAAwardsSep2020). We will be helping with Tn-seq, using Staph aureus Tn-seq libraries that will be sent to the International Space Station!

Rob was one of five junior faculty to be awarded a Colgate Award for Research Excellence (CARE).  The CARE award provides $30,000 of support for 1 year.

“The CARE Program fosters the development of junior faculty by providing seed research funding to emerging leaders in academia at a time in their career path when it is most needed,” said Maria Ryan, vice president and chief dental officer, global technology at Colgate. “Every year, we look forward to meeting and supporting talented researchers in the early stages of their careers. We are pleased to fund innovative projects that promise to advance industry knowledge and perhaps even revolutionize the field of dentistry. On behalf of Colgate, sincere congratulations to the winners of this year’s grant awards.”

Thanks for the support Colgate and congratulations to the other awardees!
