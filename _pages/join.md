## Graduate positions:

The UF Oral Biology department has a vibrant graduate student community.

Ph.D. degrees are available through the Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program ([click link for details](https://biomed.med.ufl.edu/))

## Staff Positions

As of now, we are not seeking postdoctoral research associates. That said, exceptional candidates who may be able to secure outside fellowships are encouraged to contact Rob.

## Undergraduate student positions

We are really interested in ambitious undergraduate microbiologists who want to join the team. A typical undergraduate commitment would be 8-12 hours of lab work each week. Projects will vary depending on interest, skills and time availability but here are some typical project outlines:

Types of undergraduate projects:\
1) Functional genomics screens\
2) Gene mutagenesis and characterization of mutant\
3) Analysis of pre-exisiting data (e.g. RNAseq, genomic sequencing, etc)

## A note for prospective students:

Choosing a place to study and work is a really important decision that can have a huge impact on your happiness and career trajectory. There are many factors to consider, including technical knowledge you will gain, ability to set yourself up for the next career step, characteristics of the adviser, location, and culture of the group. The best fit is different for each person. Talk to people you respect to get their advice. Try to do your research on what life in a particular group is like. For my lab, I hope to establish a culture in the group where people care about the work, freely share ideas, work together, learn together, and respect one another.
