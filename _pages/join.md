Please see below for open positions.

If interested in any of the oppurtunities, please email your CV and information about yourself to Dr. Shields (rshields{at}astate.edu). Students interested in joining our group for graduate studies must also apply to either through the Department of Biological Sciences.

## Graduate positions:

M.S. and Ph.D. degrees are available through the Molecular Biosciences Graduate Program ([link to details](https://www.astate.edu/college/sciences-and-mathematics/degrees/degree-details.dot?mid=923c2388-a12b-4652-a39d-dd4b77519a7e))

M.S. degrees are also available through a Biology program ([link to details](https://www.astate.edu/college/sciences-and-mathematics/degrees/degree-details.dot?mid=3ee79ec1-24ed-48f8-9c73-7bea39c83b77))

These M.S. and Ph.D. programs have a significant research/thesis component.

For the Molecular Biosciences program applications are accepted till Feb 15th for Fall admissions, and till July 15th for Spring admissions.

Support - most M.S. or Ph.D. students are supported either as a Graduate Teaching Assistant or Graduate Research Assistant. Alternatively students may also be supported from faculty research grants. 

## Staff Positions

As of now, we are not seeking postdoctoral research associates. That said, exceptional candidates who may be able to secure outside fellowships are encouraged to contact Rob.

*We may be hiring for a research technician position in the near future.*

## Undergraduate student positions

We are really interested in ambitious undergraduate microbiologists who want to join the team. A typical undergraduate committment would be 8-12 hours of lab work each week. Projects will vary depending on interest, skills and time availablity but here are some typical project outlines:

Types of undergraduate projects:\
1) Functional genomics screens\
2) Gene mutagenesis and characterization of mutant\
3) Analysis of pre-exisiting data (e.g. RNAseq, genomic sequencing, etc)

## A note for prospective students:

Choosing a place to study and work is a really important decision that can have a huge impact on your happiness and career trajectory. There are many factors to consider, including technical knowledge you will gain, ability to set yourself up for the next career step, characteristics of the adviser, location, and culture of the group. The best fit is different for each person. Talk to people you respect to get their advice. Try to do your research on what life in a particular group is like. For my lab, I hope to establish a culture in the group where people care about the work, freely share ideas, work together, learn together, and respect one another.

## Location and Space

Our lab is located at the following location on the Arkansas State University campus (Room 302):
